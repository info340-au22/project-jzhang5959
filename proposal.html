            We are mainly for young people who are living a stressful life and need a place to talk,
            a place for them to vent their emotions. We will design it to fit people from different
            areas. We have four sections in our web. The first board is Profile. - before starting
            to use it, the user fills in a short questionnaire, ensures the user's attributes, sets
            his name, and can choose an avatar from the provided user personality board.

            The second section is the Mood Log section. Users can add their own Mood Card for the day.
            The Mood Card is customizable and consists of a set of color blocks with colors and shapes
            that can be changed in size. The users have to give a brief description of the Mood Card,
            and if they wants, they add location. Next, users can save their Mood Card for the day in
            their Mood Log and view it at any time. In the Mood Log section, you can also create
            weekly/monthly/yearly Mood Integrated Cards and save them. By creating a daily Mood Card,
            users will begin to reflect on their day and face their moods. Recording their moods is
            not only a memento, but also a good way to express their emotions.

            The third section is Community. Users can upload their daily moods on demand (you can set
            whether to upload them automatically and publicly in the profile settings). Users can also
            see the moods uploaded by others in the Community, as well as their location, and can react
            to their posts by liking/thumbs up/emotions. By sharing their moods, users can release
            their stress in a place where no one knows them. By viewing other people's moods, they can
            also relate to their own and feel less alone. The last panel is about healing with music.
            Depending on the mood, we will put the corresponding recommended music playlist in this
            section. Also, users can select two different moods to mix playlists. Through this music,
            we hope to achieve a healing effect on people and relieve them of the daily burden of stress.
            We will use <a href="https://rapidapi.com/deezerdevs/api/deezer-1">deezer api</a> to construct our music playlist.
