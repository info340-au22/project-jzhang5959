            We are mainly for young people who are living a stressful life and need a place to talk, 
            a place for them to vent their emotions. We will design it to fit people from different 
            areas. We have <em>four sections</em> in our web. 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The first section is <em>Profile</em>. Before starting to use it, the user fills in a short questionnaire, 
              ensures the user's attributes, sets his name, and can choose an avatar from the provided user 
              personality board.
            </li>

            <li>
              The second section is the <em>Mood Log section</em>. Users can add their own Mood Card for the day.
              The Mood Card is customizable and consists of a set of color blocks with colors and shapes 
              that can be changed in size. The users have to give a brief description of the Mood Card, 
              and if they wants, they add location. Next, users can save their Mood Card for the day in 
              their Mood Log and view it at any time. In the Mood Log section, you can also create 
              weekly/monthly/yearly Mood Integrated Cards and save them. 
            </li>

            <li>
              The third section is <em>Community</em>. Users can upload their daily moods on demand (you can set
              whether to upload them automatically and publicly in the profile settings). Users can also
              see the moods uploaded by others in the Community, as well as their location, and can react
              to their posts by liking/thumbs up/emotions.
            </li>


            <li>
              The last section is about <em>Healing with Music</em></healing>. Depending on the mood, we will put the 
              corresponding recommended music playlist in this section. Also, users can select two 
              different moods to mix playlists. We will use <a href="https://rapidapi.com/deezerdevs/api/deezer-1">deezer api</a> 
              to construct our music playlist.
            </li>


          </ul>

          <p>
            By creating a daily Mood Card,users will begin to reflect on their day and face their moods.
            Recording their moods is not only a memento, but also a good way to express their emotions.
            Through sharing their moods, users can release their stress in a place where no one knows them. By 
            viewing other people's moods, they can also relate to their own and feel less alone. Through this
            music, we hope to achieve a healing effect on people and relieve them of the daily burden of stress.
