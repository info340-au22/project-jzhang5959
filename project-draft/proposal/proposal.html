             <em>Emotions</em> accompany our daily lives, particularly in contexts that provide a rich array 
             of rewarding or stressful situations. The regulation of emotions is often a voluntary and conscious 
             act to support people&apos;s psychological health and well-being, as well as help deal with negative 
             life events and stress(<a href="#Gross">Gross and John, 2003</a>; <a href="#Aldao">Aldao et al., 2010</a>; 
             <a href="#Troy2010">Troy et al., 2010</a>, <a href="#Troy2013">2013</a>; <a href="#Luhmann">Luhmann et al., 2012</a>; 
             <a href="#DeSteno">DeSteno et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#Schwager">Schwager and Rothermund, 2014</a>; 
             <a href="#Koole">Koole et al., 2015a</a>). 
             Emotion regulation deficits are present in many psychological disorders(<a href="#Werner">Werner and Gross, 2010</a>; 
             <a href="#DeSteno">DeSteno et al., 2013</a>). In the report from Mental Health America, nearly 1 In 5 American adults
              will have a diagnosable mental health condition in any given year. Therefore, to prevent from mental issues, 
              strengthening emotion regulation abilities is very significant for every of us. Success in emotion regulation has 
              many adaptive outcomes and correlates, such as better psychological health, increased well-being, better social 
              functioning, better coping with stressful life events, and even school or job success 
              (<a href="#Salovey">Salovey et al., 2010</a>).

            However, although most of us know when we are in a positive/negative mood, we don&apos;t know what &ldquo;mood&rdquo; is, 
            where it is from, and how to manage it. If we are more conscious of our emotions, we may be better able to control our lifestyle 
            choices, decide on the best course of action for our health, stop the things that make us feel bad, and seek to improve our 
            quality of life. There is an existing web app called <a href="https://emoodtracker.com/" aria-label="This is a website for eMoods.">eMoods</a>, 
            a user-friendly app for patients to track mood data relating to Depression, PTSD, and Anxiety Disorders, helping both patients and doctors 
            to visualize the mood data. Nevertheless, it doesn&apos;t serve people who would like to release their stress and vent their emotions without help from therapists.

          <p>
            We are mainly for young people who are living a stressful life and need a place to talk, 
            a place for them to vent their emotions. We will design it to fit people from different 
            areas. We have <em>four sections</em> in our web. 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The first section is <em>Profile</em>. Before starting to use it, the user fills in a short questionnaire, 
              ensures the user's attributes, sets his name, and can choose an avatar from the provided user 
              personality board.
            </li>

            <li>
              The second section is the <em>Mood Log section</em>. Users can add their own Mood Card for the day.
              The Mood Card is customizable and consists of a set of color blocks with colors and shapes 
              that can be changed in size. The users have to give a brief description of the Mood Card, 
              and if they wants, they add location. Next, users can save their Mood Card for the day in 
              their Mood Log and view it at any time. In the Mood Log section, you can also create 
              weekly/monthly/yearly Mood Integrated Cards and save them. 
            </li>

            <li>
              The third section is <em>Community</em>. Users can upload their daily moods on demand (you can set
              whether to upload them automatically and publicly in the profile settings). Users can also
              see the moods uploaded by others in the Community, as well as their location, and can react
              to their posts by liking/thumbs up/emotions.
            </li>


            <li>
              The last section is about <em>Healing with Music</em></healing>. Depending on the mood, we will put the 
              corresponding recommended music playlist in this section. Also, users can select two 
              different moods to mix playlists. We will use <a href="https://rapidapi.com/deezerdevs/api/deezer-1">deezer api</a> 
              to construct our music playlist.
            </li>


          </ul>

          <p>
            By creating a daily Mood Card,users will begin to reflect on their day and face their moods.
            Recording their moods is not only a memento, but also a good way to express their emotions.
            Through sharing their moods, users can release their stress in a place where no one knows them. By 
            viewing other people's moods, they can also relate to their own and feel less alone. Through this
            music, we hope to achieve a healing effect on people and relieve them of the daily burden of stress.
